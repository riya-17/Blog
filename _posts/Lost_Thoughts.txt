Ha! In today's world when people are so open and outcoming we realise that there are still a lot many people who are alone. In this time of pandemic when meeting anyone socializing seems quite impossible. there are people who don't have anyone to talk about. There are many people who are around a number of people still feels alone. Why does it happen? I don't know either maybe a professional will be able to answer these thoughts more technically than me. I have been trying to cop up with this pandemic myself. I am trying learning new things and making new habits. I biggest challenge is it to stop nail biting, that seems quite difficult but still I am trying a little day by day. I also spent my time on things I like and I want to learn like painting, novels and Guitar. I never thought I will ever learn guitar but here I am just like pandemic we never know what can happen haha!. I love to keep my weekends exciting so I don't suck on weekdays. Sometimes, it does feel like I should keep someone to entertain me. Just kidding!

Spending time with family is the best part of pandemic. I know whoever is now involved in corporate life has never been home in a long time. I really feel good on this part that I am getting to celebrate each and every festival with my family this time. I haven't celebrated RakshaBandhan in a long time but this year I celebrated and enjoyed it.
